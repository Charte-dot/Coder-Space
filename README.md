## UX Design
---
### Agile Planning

User stories (Issues) with acceptance criteria and tasks are each linked to an Epic (Milestone) and placed in an Iteration kanban board (Projects 1, 2 and 3). Each user story in the kanban board is labelled with a "must-have", "should-have", or "could-have" label of different colours to show their prioritisation for the project. See the table of User Stories [here](#user-stories).

### Project Goal

The goal of the project is to create an online store that sells a custom office/gaming/office space products all in one place. As the work place has changed since Covid and hybrid working is now a reality, more and more people are working at a desk space at home. The main goal was to showcase a range of products to help make a more productive work environment. A creative space that the customer can truly enjoy whilst working or creating and developing. Coder space was created for coders, software developers and software engineers at the forefront of the initial design phase. During development it became apparent that the store is for anyone looking to customize or upgrade their work space at home.

### Target audience

- People who work from home 
- People who like to play console and or online games
- People who want a stylish functional creative space to work, game or develope software
- People looking for unique office style products but with a custom feel.

### Business Goals

- To create a professional online store
- To provide an easy and secure means to purchase items.
- To increase an one stop shop for creating your personal work space
- To create a brand for the store and increase brand awareness

### Customer Goals

- To view the products available
- To buy functional office like products but with a customized feel.
- To navigate easily through the website
- To be able to pay securely for items
- To be confident that the site is genuine and trustworthy

### User Stories

Using the Agile approach Epics (Github Milestones) were created and broken down into User Stories (Github Issues). User Stories were planned out with Acceptance Criteria and Tasks assigned to each. Acceptance criteria was used in measuring testing outcomes (see [TESTING.md](https://github.com/Charte-dot/Coder-Space/blob/main/TESTING.md) ).

User Stories were sorted into Three priority levels with 1 as top priority and 3 as least prioritised. User Stories with Priority 1 were allocated a label of 1 as 'must-have', 2 as 'should-have', 3 as 'could-have'. These User Stories were divided into three Iterations (Github Projects). Some user stories have been allocated a label of 'could-have' and feature on the kanban board in iteration 3. These user stories are in the to-do column and can be previewed in the [Future Features](#future-features) section of the READ.me. User stories in the kanban board which were not implemented are marked "F" for Future Feature in the table below
